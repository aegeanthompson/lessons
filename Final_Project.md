## Schedule

**Wednesday, December 18th through Wednesday, January 8th**

- During these weeks, there is no required attendance outside of **Outcomes on Tuesdays at 4:30PM**

- There will be TA hours nearly every day check the **#sei-danlawrence-officehours** channel for updated hours.

<hr>

## Outline

During your final weeks, you will be building two projects. One will be a Portfolio site and the other will be your most ambitious and exciting project for this course!

Before you begin, note that this will be your pièce de résistance. These will be the sites that you show off to employers, so really throw yourself into it.

## Requirements

### 1. Portfolio Site

Create a site that shows off your work

[More Information](portfolio.md)

### 2. Final Project

Your final project should be an app that

- has an idea and technical stack (including database and server) that will be approved by the instructional team before you begin
- Is hosted somewhere on the internet

## Technical Requirements (Final Project)
### &#x1F534; Mandatory to pass:
#### MVP - minimum viable product

* A **git repository (or repositories) hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often
* At **least** one Github commit per day
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public
* Have a **link to your hosted working app** in the `README.md` file in  each of your github repos
* Due to the open-ended nature of this final project, each project will have their own additional MVPs that are agreed upon by the instructional team
* Demonstrate that you can **teach yourself something new**, use a technology that you haven't used in class _NOR_ on a previous project
    <details><summary>Expand for a non-exhaustive list of examples:</summary>

        - 3rd party api
        - CSS - new framework
        - CSS - no framework but use CSS-grid
        - Rails

        - React - integrate React Router
        - React UI library: Material-UI, React BootStrap etc.
        - React Enzyme testing library
        - React - use axios instead of fetch
        - Node/Express - use a new npm package

        New Stack:
        - Rails - use Angular 1.6 for front end
        - MERN stack : MongoDB, Express, React, Node
        - NERDS stack: Node, Express, React, Database SQL
        - PHP/Laravel 
        - Python/Django

        Module Bundlers:
        - Webpack - non-rails app

        Authorization:
        - Authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

        Other Hosting:
        - Host on Digital Ocean
        - Host on AWS

        - Other Libraries:
        - Lodash 
        - Google Maps
        - Moment.js
        - jQuery UI

        - D3

        Other Databases
        - Firebase
        - Redis
    </details>

ALSO, don't forget: a **technical demonstration** of your app which:

* Is ~5-10 minutes in length
* Use 1-3 minutes to show off your portfolio then switch over and talk about your app
* Shows off the features of the app
* Be sure to talk about the new thing you taught yourself
* Explains the technical details
* Explains the technical challenges
* Explains which improvements you might make

## Project due date is January 8th

As usual, fill out your project information via the [google presentation sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c9tJCuLlJJOxtGeuuIofkRLAqbrexdb84Sjt3uGHMBw/edit?usp=sharing) and remember this is the order in which you'll be presenting! January 8th is also graduation day! You'll present your final projects (portfolio inluded), and then we'll have a few graduation day activities. Attendance is of course mandatory!

## Meetings with instructors
_Your instructor will contact you to setup a meeting time to approve your final project. Project ideas must be approved before EOD December 19_

**What you should work on before meeting with an instructor:**

- Create new Github repos outside of your class repository (also, don't forget to make a `.gitignore` file, as needed)
- Create your user stories and add them to your README.md
- Write what features will meet MVP and then list out other features as stretch goals
- Make wireframes and add them to your README.md (or put images and add links)

  ## Suggested Ways to Get Started

  <details><summary>List of ways to get started</summary>

  * **Wireframe** Make a drawing of what your app will look like on each page of your application (what does it look like as soon as you log on to the site? What does it look like once a user logs in, etc.).

  <br>

  * **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually.

  <br>

  * Create your **user stories**

  <br>

  * Create a **Trello board** and break down the user stories into cards

  <br>

  * **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems

  <br>

  * Work through the lessons in class for help and inspiration! Think about adding relevant code to your application each day - you are given 5 days so that you can work on it in small chunks, COMMIT OFTEN. We will be looking at your commit dates and comments are part of your scoring.

  <br>

  * **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.

  <br>

  * **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.

  <br>

  * **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
