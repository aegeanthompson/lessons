# Korrila React Receipts

![](https://imgur.com/ysavD5R.png)

Korilla is Korean barbecue tacos truck that makes thousands of hungry customers happy every year.

Their CEO is thinking of updating their short order tracking system using React.

Build a prototype of this short order receipts tracker.

## Part 1: Get Started

Use Create React App (and don't forget to remove the .git) to set up a react project called `korilla-app`

In App.js clear out all their stuff and just have an h1 element displaying 'Hello World'

You should now have an h1 element render in the DOM


## Part 2: Sample Receipts

You'll be rendering some sample receipts:

```js
const receipt1 =
  {
    person: 'Karolin',
    order: {
      main: 'Burrito',
      protein: 'Organic Tofu',
      rice: 'Purple Rice',
      sauce: 'Green Crack',
      toppings: [
        'Baby Bok Choy', 'Cucumber Kimchi'
      ],
      drink: 'Korchata',
      cost: 22
    },
    paid: false
  }
const receipt2 = {
  person: 'Jerrica',
  order: {
    main: 'Rice Bowl',
    protein: 'Ginger Soy Chix',
    rice: 'Sticky Rice',
    sauce: 'Korilla',
    toppings: [
      'Yuzu Pickled Sweet Pepper', 'Kale'
    ],
    drink: 'Korchata',
    cost: 19
  },
  paid: false
}
const receipt3 = {
  person: 'Matt',
  order: {
    main: 'Salad Bowl',
    protein: 'Organic Tofu',
    rice: 'none',
    sauce: "K'lla",
    toppings: [
      'Blue Potato Salad', 'Pico De Gallo', 'Red Kimchi'
    ],
    drink: 'Sparkling Blood Orange Soda',
    cost: 20
  },
  paid: true
}

```

- Add the first receipt to the state of the app:

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor (props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = receipt1
  }
```


- Make a Receipt component that renders the first receipt's
  - person
  - order
      - main
      - protein
      - rice
      - sauce
      - drink
      - cost

**BONUS** (*optional*): render the toppings


Add the next two receipts to state and make two more Receipt components so that you get a veiw like this (a little css provided for clarity, but not required)

### Part 3: Conditionally Render the receipts if they have been paid or not

Right now, all the receipts are not paid ( `paid: false`)

Set up a ternary operator to display the receipt if it has not been paid.

Then go into the receipt data and change the value to true and check that the receipt will not display

To seee the `React` tab in the Dev Console, you have to download it as a [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)

## Part 4: Refactor for Dynamic Rendering

3 receipts is pretty limiting. Let's put them in an array and then map over them for rendering.

Update your code so it renders the same, but instead of hard coding 3 receipts, it maps over the array.

```js
const receipts = [
  {
    person: 'Karolin',
    order: {
      main: 'Burrito',
      protein: 'Organic Tofu',
      rice: 'Purple Rice',
      sauce: 'Green Crack',
      toppings: [
        'Baby Bok Choy', 'Cucumber Kimchi'
      ],
      drink: 'Korchata',
      cost: 22
    },
    paid: false
  },
  {
    person: 'Mark',
    order: {
      main: 'Rice Bowl',
      protein: 'Ginger Soy Chix',
      rice: 'Sticky Rice',
      sauce: 'Korilla',
      toppings: [
        'Yuzu Pickled Sweet Pepper', 'Kale'
      ],
      drink: 'Korchata',
      cost: 19
    },
    paid: false
  },
  {
    person: 'Matt',
    order: {
      main: 'Salad Bowl',
      protein: 'Organic Tofu',
      rice: 'none',
      sauce: "K'lla",
      toppings: [
        'Blue Potato Salad', 'Pico De Gallo', 'Red Kimchi'
      ],
      drink: 'Sparkling Blood Orange Soda',
      cost: 20
    },
    paid: true
  }
]
```

## Hungry For More

You'll have to read ahead in the notes...

Add a click event on the receipt that changes the value of paid from false to true. Once clicked the receipt should immediately disappear from the browser view

You'll have to research on your own...
